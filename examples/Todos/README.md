# Todos Example for Feathers

This [Feathers](http://feathersui.com/) example mocks up a simple application to track things that need to get done. It extends the MetalWorksMobileTheme and uses a custom list item renderer that can switch into an editing mode to delete items.

## Requirements

In addition to Starling Framework and Feathers, this example project requires the `MetalWorksMobileTheme` example theme. You can find the SWC file for this theme at the following location in the Feathers release build:

	themes/MetalWorksMobileTheme/swc/MetalWorksMobileTheme.swc
