# Feathers SDK and MXML

The Feathers SDK combines the application layout capabilities of MXML with the [Feathers](../) open source library of UI components. The SDK includes its own compilers and everything else that you need to develop Feathers applications. [See an overview of Feathers SDK features.](features.html)
